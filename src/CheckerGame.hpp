/*
*	The CheckerGame class has the checker game loop and keeps track of the state of the game (which player is winning).
*	This class handles manipulations to checkerpieces as well as high level AI operations. For instance, during gameplay a player will click
*	an arbitrary square to select a checker to move (green highlight), and then the player will click another square to move the checker onto (magenta highlight).
*	The computer checks to see if that jump or movement is legal by finding the square and then finding the checker that resides on the square.
*	There are 2 methods for jumping once a checker has been selected, either by selecting the checker to jump over, or by selecting an empty space beyond the checker to jump over.
*
*		***CHECKER RULES***
*	1) Pawns move forward (towards their king row) and diagonal (one square).
*	2) Kings move diagonal forward or backward (one square).
*	3) If a jump presents itself, the checker in play must jump, but it can decide which jump to take and where.
*	4) Double jumps can occur if the jumping checker does not need to make an additional move in order to secure the double jump.
*	5) A pawn can become a king by traversing from its starting row towards the farthest row opposite of the starting row on the starting board.
*	6) Last team standing wins.
*
*	It is assumed that only two players are playing at a time.
*	At the moment, player one is red, and player two is blue.
*	The checkers vector maintains an index of the checker that's in play. It should be consistent throughout the code for each turn.
